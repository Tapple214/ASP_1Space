## Running the Application

To run the application in development mode, follow these steps:

### 1. Start the Server (http://localhost:3001)

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```
   cd server
   ```
3. Install the server dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### 2. Start the Client (http://localhost:3000)

1. Open a second terminal window (do not close the first terminal).
2. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```
   cd client
   ```
3. Install the client dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the client:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Important Notes

- **Ensure that the server is running before starting the client.** The client development will not function properly if the server is not running.
- TODO: will be a standard comment used throughout the development of the app for things to be build/added
